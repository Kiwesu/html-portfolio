<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a dad of two from New Zealand. Born and raised in the Philippines, married to a beautiful lady named Angelica.</p>

<p>I currently hold a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and has practiced as a Registered Nurse overseas. However, I finally decided to pursue what I love the most which is creating and developing a website. </p>

<p>I am currently studying Certificate III in Information Technology while doing a Web Development Bootcamp with Anela Yu's awesome program. I am dreaming to be a Junior Developer soon and hoping to be in the Web Development industry soon.</p>
